**Murree** is a scenic hill station nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern Pakistan. Known for its lush green forests, charming valleys, and breathtaking mountain views, Murree is often referred to as the "City of Pines" due to its abundance of towering pine trees. A popular tourist destination, it offers a cool, refreshing climate and stunning landscapes that attract visitors year-round, particularly during the summer months when the heat of the plains makes it a perfect getaway. 

The town's picturesque streets, colonial-era architecture, and proximity to the beautiful hill resorts of Patriata, Nathiagali, and Ayubia make it a must-visit location for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts alike. With its mix of natural beauty and cultural heritage, Murree is often celebrated as one of Pakistanâ€™s most beloved hill stations.
